# webflow-node-integration

This is an experiment to use webflow as a front end development platform and node js as the server environment.

Why do this?

1. Increased control over the backend of a webflow site without in any way compromising the flexibility of its front end capabilities.
2. Expand webflow to app status. Use webflow to create html elements and partials that can then be used with node templating engines to create even more powerful dynamic elements. Don't limit ourselves to just blog posts. Let's build a usable app with webflow and node.
3. enhance development experience. With the huge number of modules available in node.js environment we can build features into the site that would have previously been impossible in webflow. Webflow is a great platform, but it's still a baby. The css is easy to manipulate but it easily becomes limiting when trying to work on scaled projects with sophisticated needs for styling and interacion. By fusing node and webflow, designers and developers can do their thing IN THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURAL HABITATS.
